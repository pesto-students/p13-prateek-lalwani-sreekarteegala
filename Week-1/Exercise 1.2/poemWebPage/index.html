        I'm Nobody! Who are you?<br />
        Are you - Nobody - Too?<br />
        Then there's a pair of us!<br />
        Don't tell! They'd banish us - you know!
    </p>

    <p>
        How dreary - to be - Somebody!<br />
        How public - like a Frog -<br />
        To tell one's name - the livelong June -<br />
        To an admiring Bog!
    </p>
