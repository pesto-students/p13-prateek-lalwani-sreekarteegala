<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1" data-line-end="2">A protocol stack is a set of standardized protocols and layers that work together to enable communication between computers over a network.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="3" data-line-end="4">In web development, the protocol stack is primarily utilized in the context of the Application Layer of the OSI model. The most prominent protocol used for web development is HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol). Here’s how the protocol stack is used in web development:</p>
<ul>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="4" data-line-end="5">Application Layer: Web applications are built using programming languages like JavaScript, Python, PHP, etc. These applications communicate with servers using the HTTP protocol.</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="5" data-line-end="6">Transport Layer: The HTTP protocol is typically carried over TCP/IP, which ensures reliable data transmission between the client (browser) and the server.</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="6" data-line-end="7">Network Layer: IP addresses are used to route data packets between different devices on the internet. Routers and switches manage the transmission of data across networks.</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="7" data-line-end="9">Data Link Layer and Physical Layer: These layers handle the actual transmission of data over physical mediums like cables and wireless connections.</li>

<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="34" data-line-end="35">Web hosting is a service that allows individuals and organizations to make their websites accessible on the internet. When we create a website , the files and data and content associated with it need to be stored over a server that is connected to the internet.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="36" data-line-end="37">There are different types of hosting services available,</p>
<ul>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="37" data-line-end="39">
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="37" data-line-end="38"><strong>Shared hosting:</strong> In shared hosting, multiple websites share the resources of a single server. It is cost effective and for smaller websites with moderate traffic. Performance may be slow.</p>
</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="39" data-line-end="41">
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="39" data-line-end="40"><strong>Virtual Private Server Hosting(VPS):</strong> VPS hosting offers a virtualized server environment where multiple users still share a physical server, but each has dedicated resources and greater control over their virtual environment.</p>
</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="41" data-line-end="43">
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="41" data-line-end="42"><strong>Dedicated hosting:</strong> With dedicated hosting, you have an entire physical server dedicated solely to your website(s). This provides the highest level of control, customization, and performance.Dedicated hosting is ideal for large websites, applications, and businesses that require extensive resources and demand high performance. It is more expensive than shared or VPS hosting due to the exclusive use of the server.</p>
</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="43" data-line-end="45">
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="43" data-line-end="44"><strong>Cloud Hosting:</strong> Cloud hosting uses a network of interconnected servers to distribute resources, making it highly scalable and resilient. It allows for easy scaling up or down based on traffic fluctuations, ensuring consistent performance. Cloud hosting is suitable for websites that experience variable or unpredictable traffic patterns.</p>
</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="45" data-line-end="47">
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="45" data-line-end="46"><strong>Managed Hosting:</strong> Managed hosting services include additional support and management for your server environment.The hosting provider takes care of tasks such as server maintenance, updates, security, and backups, allowing you to focus on your website content.Managed hosting is a good option if you want professional assistance with server management.</p>

How does scaling differ for vertical and horizontal scaling?</h3>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="49" data-line-end="50">Scaling refers to the process of handling/adjusting the resources and infrastructure of a web server to handle increased load or user traffic. It ensures us that the application can maintain optimal performance, responsiveness and reliability as the number of user requests increases. Scaling is important for web applications because it allows them to handle more users, deliver content faster, and maintain reliability under heavy loads, ultimately providing a better user experience.</p>
<ul>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="50" data-line-end="52">
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="50" data-line-end="51"><strong>Vertical scaling</strong> involves upgrading the existing server hardware to handle increased traffic. It typically includes adding more CPU power, memory, or storage to a single server. Vertical scaling is suitable for applications with moderate growth, as it simplifies management and doesn’t require major architectural changes. However, there are limits to how much a single server can be upgraded.</p>
</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="52" data-line-end="53">
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="52" data-line-end="53"><strong>Horizontal scaling</strong>, on the other hand, involves adding more servers to the application’s infrastructure. It distributes the workload across multiple servers, allowing the application to handle larger traffic spikes and scale more effectively. Horizontal scaling is well-suited for applications with rapid or unpredictable growth, as it offers better redundancy and fault tolerance. However, it may require more complex management and coordination between multiple servers.</p>
